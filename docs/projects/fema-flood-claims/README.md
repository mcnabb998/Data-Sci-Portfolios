# FEMA Flood Insurance Claim Prediction

This project demonstrates a simple machine‑learning pipeline to estimate the likelihood that a property will file a flood insurance claim.  It uses a **synthetic** dataset that loosely mimics the kind of information available in FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policy and claim data.  The goal is to illustrate feature engineering and model training in a fully reproducible example.

## Data

The dataset lives in the `data/` folder.  It contains 2,000 synthetic records with the following columns:

| Column            | Description                                    |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `flood_zone`      | FEMA flood zone category (A, V or X)           |
| `elevation`       | Base flood elevation (metres)                   |
| `year_built`      | Year the structure was built                    |
| `coverage_amount` | Policy coverage amount in USD                   |
| `mitigation_grant`| Binary indicator of whether a mitigation grant was received |
| `claim`           | Binary target; `1` indicates a claim was filed |

These values were generated by the `generate_portfolio_data.py` helper script and do **not** reflect real policy holders or claims.  The purpose is purely illustrative.

## Usage

To train the claim‑risk model and reproduce the evaluation metric printed in the portfolio summary:

```bash
# from the repository root
cd projects/fema-flood-claims/scripts
python train_model.py
```

The script loads the synthetic data, applies one‑hot encoding to the categorical variables, trains a gradient boosting classifier and reports the ROC–AUC on a held‑out test set.  You can modify the script to experiment with other algorithms or hyperparameters.

## Results

Two example plots are stored in the `results/` directory:

* **`roc_curve.png`** – Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the gradient boosting model.  The area under the curve in this synthetic example is approximately 0.82.
* **`feature_importance.png`** – Horizontal bar chart showing the relative importance of each feature in the trained model.
