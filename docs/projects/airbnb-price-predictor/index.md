# Airbnb Price Predictor 🏠💵

Predicting nightly prices for Airbnb listings in New York City using the Inside Airbnb dataset.  This project explores what drives price differences, trains a state‑of‑the‑art model and examines fairness across boroughs.

**Highlights:**

* Tree‑based models explain about **64 %** of the variance in log prices.
* Room and property type are the strongest predictors, followed by capacity and location.
* Manhattan listings have the highest median prices; the Bronx and Staten Island the lowest.
* Fairness analysis shows modest differences in error across boroughs.
