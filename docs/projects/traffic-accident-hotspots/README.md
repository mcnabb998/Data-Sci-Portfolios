# Traffic Accident Hotspot Detection

This project demonstrates how simple geospatial visualisation can reveal clusters of traffic accidents.  A synthetic dataset of accident locations and metadata is used to generate a scatter plot and identify areas with higher density.  No predictive model is trained; the focus is on exploratory visualisation.

## Data

`data/accidents.csv` contains 500 synthetic records with these fields:

| Column    | Description                             |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|
| `latitude`  | Latitude coordinate of the incident     |
| `longitude` | Longitude coordinate of the incident    |
| `weather`   | Categorical weather condition (clear, rain, fog) |
| `hour`      | Hour of day when the accident occurred  |

Coordinates were generated to form a few obvious clusters.  Weather and hour fields illustrate how additional attributes can be included for filtering.

## Usage

To reproduce the scatter plot of accident locations:

```bash
# from the repository root
cd projects/traffic-accident-hotspots/scripts
python train_model.py
```

The script reads the data and produces a scatter plot of latitude versus longitude.  You can extend it to colour points by `weather` or size them by severity, or to perform clustering with algorithms such as DBSCAN.

## Results

The `results/accident_clusters.png` file (generated by the dataset builder) illustrates where accidents tend to cluster geographically.  In the synthetic data, three distinct hotspot regions emerge.
