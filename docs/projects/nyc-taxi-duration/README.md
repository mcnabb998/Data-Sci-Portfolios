# NYC Taxi Trip Duration Model

This project predicts the duration of New York City taxi trips using features such as trip distance, boroughs, time of day and passenger count.  A gradient‑boosting regressor is trained on a **synthetic** dataset designed to resemble the NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) trip records.  The example illustrates basic regression modelling and feature engineering.

## Data

The file `data/taxi_trips.csv` contains 3,000 synthetic taxi trips with the following columns:

| Column              | Description                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `distance_km`       | Trip distance in kilometres                             |
| `pickup_borough`    | Borough where the trip began (e.g., Manhattan, Bronx)   |
| `dropoff_borough`   | Borough where the trip ended                            |
| `hour`              | Hour of pick‑up (0–23)                                  |
| `passenger_count`   | Number of passengers                                    |
| `duration_min`      | Trip duration in minutes (target variable)              |

The synthetic trip times incorporate distance and rush‑hour effects but are not based on real TLC data.

## Usage

To train the duration model and compute its error metric:

```bash
# from the repository root
cd projects/nyc-taxi-duration/scripts
python train_model.py
```

The training script performs one‑hot encoding on the categorical borough columns, trains a `GradientBoostingRegressor` and prints the mean absolute error (MAE) in minutes for the hold‑out set.

## Results

The `results/` directory contains a scatter plot `actual_vs_pred.png` (generated by the dataset builder) showing predicted versus actual trip durations.  In general, the model follows the trend, although there is noise due to the synthetic nature of the data.
