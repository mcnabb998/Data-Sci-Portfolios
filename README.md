A collection of data-science projects examining how star ratings align with text sentiment, alongside a sample sports analytics study. Each project highlights methods, visuals, and reproducible code using open datasets.

The `docs/` folder contains a minimal GitHub Pages site that links out to individual portfolio pieces. Project-specific materials live under `projects/`, each with its own README and assets.

## Projects
